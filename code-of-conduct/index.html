            <p>Polyglot.LA is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, the vendor hall, parties, Twitter and other forms of social media.</p>
